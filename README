Building Hoard (Unix)
---------------------

To build Hoard on non-Windows platforms, change into the src/
directory and run "make" followed by the appropriate target. If you
type "make", it will present a list of available targets. These
include linux-gcc-x86, solaris-sunw-sparc, etc.

You can then use Hoard by linking it with your executable, or
by setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, as in

  % export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libhoard.so

in Solaris:

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_32.so:/usr/lib/libCrun.so.1"
  (32-bit version)

  % export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libhoard_64.so:/usr/lib/64/libCrun.so.1"
  (64-bit version)

or, in Mac OS X:

  % export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/libhoard.dylib

Building Hoard (Windows)
------------------------

Change into the src directory and type "nmake windows", as in:

  C:\hoard\src> nmake windows

To use Hoard, link your executable with 'source\uselibhoard.cpp' and 'winhoard.lib'.
You *must* use the /MD flag.

Example:
  C:\hoard\src> cl /Ox /MD yourapp.cpp source\uselibhoard.cpp libhoard.lib

To run yourapp.exe, you will need to have libhoard.dll in your path.

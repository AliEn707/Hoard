  Heap Layers provides a flexible infrastructure for composing
  high-performance memory allocators out of C++ "layers". Heap Layers
  makes it easy to write high-quality custom and general-purpose
  memory allocators.

  Heap Layers contains a number of ready-made heap components that can
  be plugged together with minimal effort, and the result is often
  faster than hand-built allocators. The PLDI 2001 paper "Composing
  High-Performance Memory Allocators" paper has plenty of examples:

  Heap Layers can substantially outperform its only real competitor,
  the Vmalloc package from AT&T. The "Reconsidering Custom Memory
  Allocation" paper has more details:
    <http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/berger-oopsla2002.pdf>

  Not only is Heap Layers much higher level and simpler to use, but
  its use of templates also improves performance. Heap Layers both
  eliminates the function call overhead imposed by Vmalloc layers and
  yields higher quality code by exposing more optimization
  opportunities.

  For an introduction to Heap Layers, read the article "Policy-Based
  Memory Allocation" at <http://www.drdobbs.com/184402039>, by Andrei
  Alexandrescu and Emery Berger.  It's a good overview.
